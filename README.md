Tech Stack
Language: Java 17+
GUI: JavaFX
Build Tool: Apache Maven
Database: PostgreSQL
Camera Control & AI: JavaCV (OpenCV Wrapper)
Face Detection (Haar Cascades)
Training & Recognition (LBPH Model)
QR Code Scanning: ZXing (Zebra Crossing)
JSON Processing: Google GSON

Key Features
Multi-threaded GUI: The user interface (UI) remains smooth by processing camera feeds and heavy tasks (AI, DB) on separate threads, updating the UI safely via Platform.runLater().
2-Factor Authentication (2FA):
QR Code Scan: Uses the camera to scan a QR code (containing JSON) for identification (id, name).
Face Verification: After scanning the QR, a popup window opens, requiring the user to verify their face. The system compares the face against the scanned id to prevent fraud (buddy punching).
AI System (Training & Recognition):
Enrollment: A feature allowing Admins to capture multiple photos (dataset) of new users.
Training: Automatically (or manually) trains an AI model (model.yml) from the image dataset.
Session Management:
Start/End Session: Admins can begin and end an attendance session.

Export Report: At the end of a session, the system automatically generates a .txt report summarizing work hours for everyone.
Auto-Clear: Automatically clears the session's attendance data to prepare for the next session.

⚙️ Setup & Running the Project
This project requires database setup and AI training before running.
1. Database Setup (PostgreSQL)
   Install PostgreSQL on your machine.
Open pgAdmin (or psql terminal) and create a new database, e.g., attendance_db.
Run the following 2 SQL commands to create the necessary tables:

CREATE TABLE userdetails (
id INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
gender VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
contact VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
avatar_path VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE userattendance (
userid INT NOT NULL,
date DATE NOT NULL,
checkin TIMESTAMP,
checkout TIMESTAMP,
workduration VARCHAR(50)
);
Open the file src/main/java/dao/ConnectionProvider.java.

Edit the LOCAL_DB_NAME, LOCAL_USER, and LOCAL_PASSWORD variables to match the database you just created.

2. AI Setup & Training (Very Important)
   The system must be "taught" to recognize faces.
Run EnrollmentController:
Run the application and open the Face Enrollment screen (this is the Enrollment.fxml file).
Enter the ID of a user (e.g., 3. This ID must exist in the userdetails table).
Click the "Start Capture" button and take about 30-50 photos from various angles.
Repeat for all users.
Photos will be saved in the dataset/ directory at the project root.
Train the Model:
After capturing photos, the app will automatically run the FaceTrainer (or you can run utility/FaceTrainer.java manually).
Wait for it to process...
A new file named model.yml will be created. This is your AI "brain".
(Note: model.yml is already in .gitignore to protect facial data and will not be pushed to GitHub).

3. QR Code Setup
   During check-in, the system requires scanning a QR code containing a JSON string in the following format:
JSON
{"id": "3", "name": "PhongPham", "email": "a@1234"}
(Ensure the id and name match the user you enrolled).

4. Running the Application
Clone the project
How to run (using Maven):
Bash
mvn clean javafx:run
How to package (Build a standalone .jar file):
Bash
mvn clean package
(The runnable .jar file will be in the target/ directory)

5. Logging In:
The default account is admin|123
